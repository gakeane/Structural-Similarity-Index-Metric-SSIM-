# Structural-Similarity-Index-Metric-SSIM-
Code used to develop a plug-in for the NUKE image processing software which adds the structural similarity index metric (SSIM). This metric is used to determine the quality of an image by comparing it to a reference image. The value of this metric will be between 0 and 1 where 1 indicates identical images.
